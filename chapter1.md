# Install Consoul

Before we can install and initialize the vault, we need to install and setup the Secure Key-Store service. In our case this is Consul, which can be downloaded from [https://www.consul.io/](https://www.consul.io/).

We will create an init script in ```/etc/init.d``` and register it so that the Consul service startes when the server boots.
